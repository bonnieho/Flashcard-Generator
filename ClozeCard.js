/*
        This file should define a Node module that exports a constructor for creating cloze-deletion flashcards, e.g.: module.exports = ClozeCard;

        The constructor should accept two arguments: text and cloze.

        The constructed object should have a cloze property that contains only the cloze-deleted portion of the text.

        The constructed object should have a partial property that contains only the partial text.

        The constructed object should have a fullText property that contains only the full text.

        The constructor should throw or log an error when the cloze deletion does not appear in the input text.

        Use prototypes to attach these methods, wherever possible.

The bulk of this assignment is implementing ClozeCard. If you build a robust ClozeCard implementation, feel free to try your hand at implementing a front-end, as well.
Examples

Your constructors should work as follows.

var firstPresident = new BasicCard(
    "Who was the first president of the United States?", "George Washington");

// "Who was the first president of the United States?"
console.log(firstPresident.front); 

// "George Washington"
console.log(firstPresident.back); 

var firstPresidentCloze = new ClozeCard(
    "George Washington was the first president of the United States.", "George Washington");

// "George Washington"
console.log(firstPresidentCloze.cloze); 

// " ... was the first president of the United States.
console.log(firstPresidentCloze.partial); "

// "George Washington was the first president of the United States.
console.log(firstPresidentCloze.fullText): "

// Should throw or log an error because "oops" doesn't appear in "This doesn't work"
var brokenCloze = new ClozeCard("This doesn't work", "oops");

Bonuses

    Write your constructors such that users can call them with or without the new keyword.
        Look up scope-safe constructors, and try to implement them. It takes only two additional lines of code.
